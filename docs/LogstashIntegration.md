## Installation

To enable communication with Logstash the ruby gem needs to be installed into
the Logstash installation, and then the input and output plugins.

The following instructions assume you are using the tar.gz or packaged Logstash
installations and that Logstash is installed to /opt/logstash. You should change
this path if yours is different.

First build the gem. This will generate a file called log-courier-X.X.gem.

		git clone https://github.com/driskell/log-courier
		cd log-courier
		make gem

Then switch to the Logstash installation directory and install it. Note that
because this is JRuby it may take a minute to finish the install. The
ffi-rzmq-core and ffi-rzmq gems bundled with Logstash will be upgraded during
the installation, which will require an internet connection.

		cd /opt/logstash
		export GEM_HOME=vendor/bundle/jruby/1.9
		java -jar vendor/jar/jruby-complete-1.7.11.jar -S gem install <path-to-gem>

Now install the Logstash plugins.

		cd <log-courier-source>
		cp -rvf lib /opt/logstash

## Remote Installation

If you need to install the gem on a server without an internet connection, you
must download the latest ffi-rzmq-core and ffi-zmq gems from the rubygems site
and transfer them across.

* https://rubygems.org/gems/ffi-rzmq-core
* https://rubygems.org/gems/ffi-rzmq

These gems should be installed before the log-courer gem. As a result, the
log-courier gem installation will not need them to be downloaded.

## Configuration

The 'courier' input and output plugins will now be available. An example
configuration for the input plugin follows.

		input {
				courier {
						port            => 12345
						ssl_certificate => "/opt/logstash/ssl/logstash.cer"
						ssl_key         => "/opt/logstash/ssl/logstash.key"
				}
		}

The following options are available for the input plugin:

* transport - "tcp", "tls", "plainzmq" or "zmq" (default: "tls")
* address - Interface address to listen on (defaults to all interfaces)
* port - The port number to listen on
* ssl_certificate - Path to server SSL certificate (tls)
* ssl_key - Path to server SSL private key (tls)
* ssl_key_passphrase - Password for ssl_key (tls, optional)
* ssl_verify - If true, verifies client certificates (tls, default false)
* ssl_verify_default_ca - Accept client certificates signed by systems root CAs
(tls)
* ssl_verify_ca - Path to an SSL CA certificate to use for client certificate
verification (tls)
* curve_secret_key - CurveZMQ secret key for the server (zmq)
* max_packet_size - The maximum packet size to accept (default 10485760,
corresponds to Log Courier's `"spool max bytes"`)

The following options are available for the output plugin:

* addresses - Address to connect to in array format (only the first address will
be used at the moment)
* port - Port to connect to
* ssl_ca - Path to SSL certificate to verify server certificate
* ssl_certificate - Path to client SSL certificate (optional)
* ssl_key - Path to client SSL private key (optional)
* ssl_key_passphrase - Password for ssl_key (optional)
* spool_size - Maximum number of events to spool before a flush is forced
(default 1024)
* idle_timeout - Maxmimum time in seconds to wait for a full spool before
flushing anyway (default 5)

NOTE: The tcp, plainzmq and zmq transports are not implemented in the output
plugin at this time. It supports only the tls transport.
