# Packaging Instructions

Install required package building packages.

```shell
sudo apt-get install devscripts debhelper golang-go
```

Run the following commands to get the source, create the required upstream
archive, setup the source for debian building, and build the package.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/driskell/log-courier
tar -czf log-courier_VERSION.orig.tar.gz log-courier
cd log-courier
# You can build the package for either upstart or systemd
# upstart
mv contrib/deb-upstart debian
# systemd
# mv contrib/deb-systemd debian
dpkg-buildpackage
```

## Packaging on Wheezy

The version of 'go' available in the golang-go package available in Debian
wheezy is not recent enough to build this package. The following procedure
can be followed as a workaround.

First, grab the latest go from <https://golang.org/> and install as standard in
/usr/local/go (debian's current packaged version is not new enough).

Add go to the PATH

```shell
export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH
```

Build the packages as normal.

## Building a Source DEB

Follow the instructions for a regular package using the following command
instead of dpkg-buildpackage.

```shell
debuild -S -sa
```

If you need to set the target distribution for the source package, such as for
upload to PPA, you can run the following command before debuild to set it,
replacing trusty with the desired distribution name.

```shell
dch -r -M -D trusty
```
