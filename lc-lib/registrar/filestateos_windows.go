	// info is os.FileInfo which is an interface to a
	// - *os.fileStat (holding methods) which is a pointer to a
	// - os.fileStat (holding data)
	// ValueOf will pick up the interface contents immediately, so we need a single Elem()

	// Ensure that the numbers are loaded by calling os.SameFile
	// os.SameFile will call sameFile (types_windows.go) which will call *os.fileStat's loadFileId
